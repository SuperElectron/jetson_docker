Source Software. Customer hereby irrevocably  accepts and agrees to be
bound by  the terms  of this  license as it  pertains to  the RidgeRun
Software   and   the  applicable   licenses   for   the  Open   Source
Software. Customer  agrees to review  each of the open  source license
agreements  that  accompany  the  Open Source  Software  in  order  to
understand its  rights of  use for  the Open  Source Software  and the
related restrictions.  Customer may  consult the  online documentation
that  accompanies the  Open Source  Software for  the applicable  open
source license agreement.

3.2 Customer may  not cause or permit any of  its Authorized Users to:
decompile, disassemble, reverse assemble, "unlock" or reverse engineer
the  RidgeRun Software;  or  sublicense, lease,  sell,  rent, lend  or
transfer the RidgeRun Software, except as expressly authorized in this
Agreement.

3.3  All copies  of  the Software  shall contain  any  and all  title,
copyright,  trademark,  and proprietary  rights  notices  in favor  of
RidgeRun or third  party licensors placed on the  Software by RidgeRun
or such third parties, or as requested by RidgeRun. Customer agrees to
maintain and not alter, erase,  deface or otherwise overprint any such
notices  without prior  written approval  of RidgeRun  or third  party
licensor. "RidgeRun" is a trademark  of RidgeRun, LLC. "Linux(r)" is a

RidgeRun all  changes made  by the Customer  to the  RidgeRun Software
Source Code. Further  Customer agrees to relinquish any  rights to the
RidgeRun Software Source Code given  to RidgeRun. This agreement gives
RidgeRun the  right to  incorporate Customer  changes to  the RidgeRun
Software  Source  Code   and  treat  the  resultant   Source  Code  as
exclusively owned by RidgeRun.

 
4. Confidentiality

4.1 Except for the licenses granted herein or in the licenses for Open
Source Software, all rights, title and interest in and to the Software
shall  be solely  and exclusively  owned  by and  are the  proprietary
products of RidgeRun or the third party licensors and are protected by
copyright  and  other laws.  Any  use  of  the RidgeRun  Software  not
expressly provided for in this  Agreement is expressly prohibited. The
RidgeRun Software and all intellectual property rights related thereto
that may  exist from time to  time in this or  any other jurisdiction,
whether  foreign  or  domestic,   under  patent  law,  copyright  law,
publicity rights  law, moral rights  law, trade secret  law, trademark
law  or  other  proprietary  rights,  whether  or  not  registered  or
perfected  ("RidgeRun  Proprietary   Information"),  constitute  trade
secrets  and  proprietary  data  of  RidgeRun,  and  nothing  in  this
Agreement shall be  construed to convey any title  or ownership rights
to Customer. Customer agrees to use  its best efforts to safeguard the
confidentiality   of  the   RidgeRun  Proprietary   Information.  Each
component of the Open Source  Software has its own applicable end-user
license  agreement.  Third  party   licensors  under  such  agreements
continue to  own all  rights, title  and interest in  and to  the Open
Source Software. Customer's rights to use the Open Source Software are
specified in open source license  agreements for each component of the
Open Source Software.

4.2  The term  "confidential information"  shall mean  any information
obtained by  either party("Receiving Party") from  the other party(the
"Disclosing  Party")  in  connection  with  this  Agreement  which  is
obtained in writing,  orally, by inspection or otherwise  and which is
confidential  or proprietary  to the  Disclosing Party.  The Receiving
Party  shall  treat  as   confidential  all  confidential  information
received from  the Disclosing Party,  shall not use  such confidential
information except  as expressly  permitted under this  Agreement, and
shall not  disclose such confidential  information to any  third party
without the  Disclosing Party's  prior written consent.  The Receiving
Party  shall  use  the  same  measures  to  protect  the  confidential
information that  it takes  with its  own confidential  information of
like kind, but  in no event less than reasonable  measures, to prevent
the   disclosure   and   unauthorized    use   of   the   confidential
information.  Notwithstanding  the  above, the  restrictions  of  this
section shall  not apply  to information  that: (a)  was independently
developed by the  Receiving Party without any use  of the confidential
information  of  the  Disclosing  Party;  (b)  becomes  known  to  the
Receiving Party, without  restriction, from a third  party without the
breach of this Agreement  and who had a right to  disclose it; (c) was
in  the public  domain through  no act  or omission  of the  Receiving
Party;  (d)  was rightfully  known  to  the Receiving  Party,  without
restriction, at the time of  the Disclosing Party's disclosure; or (e)
is  disclosed  pursuant  to  an  order  or  requirement  of  a  court,
administrative agency, or other  governmental body; provided, however,
that the Receiving  Party shall provide prompt  written notice thereof
to the Disclosing  Party and shall use its reasonable  best efforts to
obtain such protective order or otherwise prevent public disclosure of
such information.

4.3  Customer  agrees   to  notify  all  Authorized   Users  of  their
obligations hereunder and to bind any such Authorized Users in writing
to obligations no less restrictive than the provisions of this section
4. The parties acknowledge that confidential information is unique and
valuable, and that disclosure in  breach of this Agreement will result
in irreparable injury  to Disclosing Party for  which monetary damages
alone would  not be  an adequate  remedy.Therefore, the  parties agree
that in the event of a breach or threatened breach of confidentiality,
Disclosing  Party  shall  be  entitled  to  specific  performance  and
injunctive or other  equitable relief as a remedy for  any such breach
or anticipated  breach without  the necessity of  posting a  bond. Any
such relief shall be in addition to and not in lieu of any appropriate
relief in the way of monetary damages.
 

5. Termination

The term  of this Agreement shall  commence on the effective  date and
continue in full force for one(1) years unless terminated earlier upon
the occurrence of  any of the following:if customer fails  to make any
payment  due  within  15  days after  receiving  written  notice  from
RidgeRun that such payment is  delinquent, RidgeRun may terminate this
Agreement on written notice to customer  at any time following the end
of such 15 day period; if either party materially breaches any term or
condition of  this Agreement and fails  to cure that breach  within 30
days after receiving written notice of the breach, the non - breaching
party  may terminate  this Agreement  on  written notice  at any  time
following the end  of such 30 day  period; at any time  by RidgeRun if
the  Software  is  being  provided   to  customer  hereunder  for  its
evaluation and  / or testing;  or if customer  becomes insolvent(i.e.,
becomes unable to pay its debts  in the ordinary course of business as
they  come due)  or  makes an  assignment of  this  Agreement for  the
benefit  of   creditors.  Upon  expiration  or   termination  of  this
Agreement:  all  license  rights granted  hereunder  shall  terminate;
customer shall return  to RidgeRun, or destroy and  certify in writing
the   destruction  of   all   copies  of   the  RidgeRun   Proprietary
Information(including  without limitation  the Software)  and RidgeRun
confidential information; and  the provisions of sections 4,  5, 7, 8,
9, and 13 of this Agreement shall survive termination.
 

6. Software Support

Software  support  provided  by  RidgeRun  during  the  term  of  this
Agreement  will  be   limited  to  website  support   as  provided  on

7. Limited Warranty

If the Software is provided on media, RidgeRun warrants that the media
on  which the  Software  is provided  to customer  will  be free  from
defects in materials and manufacture under  normal use for a period of
30 days  from the  date of  delivery to customer.  If a  defect occurs
within this 30 day period, customer  may return the defective media to
RidgeRun for  a replacement  at no charge.  This remedy  is customer's
sole  and  exclusive remedy  for  breach  of this  warranty.  Customer
acknowledges  that  the  Software  is provided  "as  is"  without  any
warranty.  RidgeRun  does not  warrant  that  the Software  will  meet
Customer's requirements or that its operation will be uninterrupted or
error-free. To the extent allowed by law, RidgeRun expressly disclaims
all express warranties  not stated herein and  all implied warranties,
including  the  implied  warranties  as to  quality,  performance,  or
merchantability and fitness  for a particular purpose  or any warranty
of non-infringement. Some states do  not allow limitations on how long
an implied warranty lasts, so the  above limitations may not apply. No
RidgeRun  agent  or employee  is  authorized  to make  any  expansion,
modification,  or  addition  to   this  limitation  and  exclusion  of
warranties or to any other restriction detailed in this Agreement. The
Open Source Software is provided "as  is", as further described in the
GNU  public   license  and   other  applicable  open   source  license
agreements.

any liability  with respect to  the content of any  RidgeRun Software,
including but  not limited to  errors or omissions  contained therein,
libel, infringement of rights of publicity, privacy, trademark rights,
moral rights, or the disclosure of confidential information.

Customer   hereby   waives   any  right   to   indirect,   incidental,
consequential, special,  exemplary or  punitive damages of  any nature
whatsoever, (including  lost profits, data, goodwill  or use thereof),
whether such damages are alleged as a result of tort (including strict
liability), contract, warranty or otherwise.  Some states do not allow
the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so
the above  limitation may not  apply to you. RidgeRun's  liability for
direct  damages arising  under  this Agreement  shall  not exceed  the
aggregate of the fees paid to RidgeRun pursuant to this Agreement.
 

9. Indemnification

affiliates,  and   its  and  their  respective   officers,  directors,

out of  or resulting from a  breach of this Agreement.  RidgeRun shall
give customer prompt  written notice of such claim  and customer shall
have   sole  control   of  the   defense,  settlement   or  compromise
thereof. RidgeRun may elect to participate  in the defense of any such
claim with an attorney of its own choice and at its own expense.

Customer  shall promptly  provide written  notice to  RidgeRun of  any
conduct  of any  individual or  entity (including  without limitation,
customer, its  employees or  consultants) of  which customer  is aware
